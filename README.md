EMO Energy | Strategic Growth Framework (2025–2027)
This project outlines a comprehensive growth and execution plan to scale EMO Energy's battery and energy storage solutions, aiming to power 100,000 electric 2/3W vehicles and deploy 1 GWh of energy storage by 2027. It addresses the core challenges in India's EV ecosystem such as high TCO, safety risks, and infrastructure gaps—through EMO's ZEN ecosystem, which includes modular batteries, fast chargers, and the AI-powered SENS platform.

Key Highlights:
10x TCO reduction through AI, modular hardware, and ESS-as-a-service

Safe, certified batteries (UL 2580, AIS) with 20-minute charging

Scalable energy storage for fleets, OEMs, and C&I use cases

Strategic GTM & unit economics for aggressive revenue scaling

Estimated 176.9 K tons CO₂ reduction and 1,000 MWh deployed by 2027

Built to support India's green mobility push and digital commerce boom, the framework combines deep market insight, execution levers, and strong partner alliances to deliver measurable, climate-positive growth.
